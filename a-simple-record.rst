A wildlife recording system is nothing without the records it contains, so what better
way to start learning iRecord than to input a simple record. The exact information you 
might want to record will depend on what you are recording and why you are recording it, 
but most agree that all biological records need to include the following information:

  * Who recorded it
  * Where it was recorded
  * When it was recorded
  * What was recorded

We will normally be logged in to iRecord when we input records, so the system already knows who
you are and can use this information to provide the default value for "who recorded it".
iRecord includes a limited number of ways of inputting records even when you are not 
logged into the system but in these cases you would be asked to fill in basic details of 
yourself. As iRecord is far more useful when logged in, we'll be focusing on inputting
data as a logged in user. The other key parts of a record, the "where, when and what" 
will need to be input when you add a record to the system.

.. tip::

  When practicing using iRecord to input records, if you want to input data that are not
  real make sure you turn on the **training** option in your user profile. 
  :doc:`More information on using the training option<training>` or `watch how to do this 
  this on YouTube <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBq73EDZ95w>`_.

To add a record:

1. First make sure you are logged in.
2. Select **Record > Enter a casual record** from the main menu. This takes you to the 
   form which you will fill in for general ad-hoc records. There are other forms for 
   lists of records as well as forms catering for specific surveys, species groups and 
   places which we will learn about later. The top half of this form allows you to set
   most details of the record other than the locality information, which we will come to
   in a moment.

3. For this tutorial. we're going to input the very minimal details required for a record.
   Click in the box beside the **Date** label and you will see that a calendar panel pops
   down making it really easy to simply click on the correct date. If you need previous
   months or years then you can use the controls at the top of the panel to change the
   visible month. Obviously future dates are not allowed.

   So, click on today's date to set the date for the record.
4. The **Recorder Name** field has already been filled in with our name as a default 
   value, so the next piece of information we must provide for our minimalistic record is 
   the species name. Click in the box next to the **Species** label. Start typing the 
   first few characters of a species name, e.g. "blueb" to search for 
   Bluebell, *Hyacinthoides non-scripta*. The list of possible matched species names 
   appears below the input box:

      :alt: Searching for bluebell species name.
    
   If the species you are looking for has come to the top of the box then simply press
   return to select it, or you can use the arrow keys to navigate in the list then press
   return when the species you want is highlighted.
5. The final piece of information we need to provide for our record is some information on
   the place, such as a grid reference. There are several ways to do this, but the 
   quickest is to scroll down the page till you can see the map, then move the mouse over
   the map to the general area of the record. As you hover over the map, you can see 
   a dotted outline of the grid square which you are currently over informing you where 
   the grid square will be set when you click. Don't worry about making it too precise at
   this stage - simply click on the map in the approximate location of the record. The map 
   will now zoom in so that you can click again to set a more precise grid reference. 
   Repeat this until your grid reference is placed to an appropriate level of precision. 
   A 10m grid square is a good aim.

   .. note::

     We'll learn about repeat recording at sites as well as how to increase the grid 
     reference precision to 1m later.
6. Finally, click the Submit button to save your record.
