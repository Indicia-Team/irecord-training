General Purpose Data Entry Forms
********************************

When using iRecord, there are 3 general purpose data entry forms which will always be
available to you. Since these let you record any species group, each record only has some
basic attributes which are relevant to most groups. We've already briefly used the
:doc:`Enter a casual record <enter-casual-record>` form when we :doc:`entered a
minimalistic record <../a-simple-record>` earlier. In this section we'll take a look at 
this form in more detail as well as the following forms:

  * :doc:`enter-records-list`
  * :doc:`enter-records-at-several-places`
  
.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 2
  :hidden:
  
  enter-casual-record
  enter-records-list
  enter-records-at-several-places
