Why iRecord?
************

Hopefully, if you're reading this page I don't need to go into details as to why wildlife
recording can be a fascinating and rewarding activity. Hopefully after reading this you
will realise that iRecord can not only make wildlife recording more enjoyable but also can
help you to ensure that your records are fully utilised. At it's most fundamental level
wildlife records are collected on paper or even in digital form such as a spreadsheet.
It's all to easy for the records to get forgotten about and left exactly where they are; 
the records are then not available for anything from planning decisions to research.
Contrastingly, by using an online recording system like iRecord you can easily:

  * Share your sightings with the recording community
  * Explore dynamic maps and graphs of your data
  * Ensure that your records are available to appropriate organisations and therefore make
    a real contribution to science and conservation.

Online wildlife recording presents a plethora of new opportunities :

  * Sharing records is simplified to the point that the recorder need not actually do 
    anything other than add their records to the system. Records can be easily shared
    with other recorders, local record centres and the NBN Gateway.
  * By sharing our records, we can learn from the experiences of others such as what is
    being recorded on our patch by others, what identifications are being verified by
    experts and so forth.
