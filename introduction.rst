Why iRecord?
************

If you're reading this page then I'm sure I don't need to go into details as to why
wildlife recording can be a fascinating and rewarding activity. Hopefully after reading
this you will realise that iRecord can not only make wildlife recording more enjoyable but
can make your recording efforts become much more worthwhile by ensuring that your records
are fully utilised. At it's most fundamental level wildlife records are collected on paper
or even in digital form such as a spreadsheet. It's all to easy for the records to get
forgotten about and left exactly where they are; the records are then not available for
anything from planning decisions to research. Contrastingly, by using an online recording
system like iRecord you can easily:

  * Share your sightings with the recording community
  * Explore dynamic maps and graphs of your data
  * Ensure that your records are available to appropriate organisations and therefore make
    a real contribution to science and conservation.

Online wildlife recording presents a plethora of new opportunities :

  * Sharing records is simplified to the point that the recorder need not actually do 
    anything other than add their records to the system. Records can be easily shared
    with other recorders, local record centres and the NBN Gateway.
  * By sharing our records, we can learn from the experiences of others such as what is
    being recorded on our patch by others, what identifications are being verified by
    experts and so forth.
  * By sharing our records, we can get rapid feedback from experts and other recorders on
    record quality issues.
  * By sharing our records, we can ensure our records are of maximum value and not just 
    only known to ourselves.
    
.. tip::

  iRecord's philosophy is that record sharing is a fundamental part of wildlife recording. 
  In fact, unless there are sensitivity issues relating to a record iRecord allows public 
  access to the record in full detail for non-commercial users. iRecord is not the right 
  tool for you if you want to keep a private list of records!
