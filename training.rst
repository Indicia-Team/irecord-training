Using Training Mode in iRecord
******************************

If you are concerned about putting records into iRecord whilst you are still learning the 
ropes, don't worry as iRecord has a training option. This allows you to:

  * flag records you enter as training records so they won't be sent on to experts, local 
    environmental record centres or the NBN Gateway.
  * filter the reports you see so that you can see the training records.

To enable training mode, follow these steps:

  1. Select **My Account** from the link in the top right of the screen.
  2. Click on the **Edit** tab, under the **My Account** title.
  3. Click on the **Preferences** tab.
  4. Tick the **Training** checkbox.
  5. Scroll to the bottom and click the **Save** button.
  
The following screenshot shows the My Account link, Edit tab, Preferences tab and Training
checkbox:

  `Follow the YouTube video showing you how to enable training mode <http://youtu.be/PBq73EDZ95w>`_. 

Once you are in training mode, you will find that a message is displayed at the top of
each page warning you. You can see from the following screenshot that the records visible
on the home page are those which I've previously input whilst in training mode.

Don't forget to unset the training option when you want to start inputting live records!
When you do this, your training records will remain in the system but will be hidden from
view until you choose to return to training mode.
